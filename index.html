        <h2>Welcome to Our Yard</h2>
    <p>Back in 2016, we stood at the edge of a dusty backyard with a big dream and a rough sketch on paper. 
      We mapped out everything we wanted: a spot for the trampoline, a cozy firepit, a peaceful waterfall, and a court 
      for games and gatherings.</p>
      <p>
        When the bids came in, we had a serious case of sticker shock. So instead of shelving the dream, 
        we sold our travel trailer and bought a mini-excavator. From that day on, it became a true family project. 
        We sorted and hauled rocks by hand, carved trenches through stubborn clay, laid pipes, pulled electrical wires, 
        planted so many plants, and positioned every piece of the rock walls and stone steps ourselves, sometimes twice 
        (okay, maybe three times) to get it right. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s still a work in progress, but now it’s more than just a yard, it’s our story, built one paver at a time.
        Today, we’re honored to share this space with others. Over the years, our yard has hosted wedding receptions, a wedding proposal, 
        backyard concerts, birthday parties, and so many BBQ and smores nights. Every glowing fire, every light strung overhead, and every 
        yard game under the trees reminds us the hard work was worth it.
